Random Pictures

Submitted by: Juan Linares Orihuela

Random Pictures is an app that changes the background color randomly when the user taps the button color time. This app could be used as a fidgeting app, that way the user can find some entertainment and awesome colors while tapping the screen.

Time spent: 2 hours

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

· I wasn't able to figure out how to center the title "Random Pictures".
· Learning Github and Git while working on the project.
· Make an interesting README page where people can understand the project.
